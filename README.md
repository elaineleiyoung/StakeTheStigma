## Project Description:  
Stake the Stigma is a project aimed at destigmatizing women's health topics by providing a personalized dashboard experience for users. The goal of this project is to make it easier for people to access and search for specific articles and insights related to women's health topics. By doing so, the project aims to increase awareness and communication about important but often underrepresented subjects in society.

The personalized dashboard experience allows users to customize their experience based on their preferences and interests. Users can choose specific topics or areas of interest, and the dashboard will then display summarized articles and insights related to those topics. Users can also search for specific articles or keywords to find resources related to those queries and add such articles into the dashboard. There is also a separate contributor feed which features articles written or shared by contributors, who have integrated such articles into our database.

## Built with:  
React frontend, Firebase Backend. 

## Installation: npm and Firebase 
 
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from https://nodejs.org.
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
### git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
To change to the project directory:
### cd your-project
Install the project dependencies:
### `npm i`
This will install all the dependencies required to run the project. You should see a node_modules directory created in your project directory. The dependencies used are: 
- "@emotion/react": "^11.10.6"
- "@emotion/styled": "^11.10.6"
- "@mui/icons-material": "^5.11.9"
- "@mui/material": "^5.11.13"
- "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5"
- "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0"
- "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0"
- "firebase": "^9.17.1"
- "framer-motion": "^10.9.1"
- "jquery": "^3.6.4"
- "react": "^18.2.0"
- "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
- "react-loader-spinner": "^5.3.4"
- "react-pro-sidebar": "^1.0.0"
- "react-promise-tracker": "^2.1.1"
- "react-router-dom": "^6.8.1"
- "react-scripts": "5.0.1"
- "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"

To install firebase:
### `npm install firebase` 

## Running the App:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
